## Description

This project was created to provide users with functionality of `creating and modifying surveys`, as well as `gathering data from the surveys`.

This software will be helpful for `organizations and companies` to `gather feedback` on different matters and to `analyze this feedback` in different aspects.

## Structure

The project consists of a `client application` and `cloud-functions`.

The `client` is used to provide users with `visual interface` and `core functionalities` of the application.

    The backend was not implemented in this project because the communication with the database is provided via Firebase API, which makes it easier for developers to execute queries on the database.

The `cloud-functions` folder has not been taken in use yet, however it is strongly possible that several functionalities will demand using cloud functions.
